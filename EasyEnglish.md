**Check-in**

> May I see you passport, please?

> Here you go.

> Thank you. And where are you flying with us today?

> I'm going to London. I'll be studing there for a year.

> How fun! That sounds like a great trip. I see your information right here. Are you checking any bags today?

> Yes. Just one.

> Perfect. If you could please place it on the scale for me, that would be great.

> Here you go.

> Thank you. Hmmm. It appears your bag is just a bit too heavy. It is over your weight requirement. Perhaps you could take something out of your bag and put it in your **carry-on bag**?

> Yes! I'll take this big book out of the bag. No broblem.

> Great! Now your bag is ready to be checked. I see you've chosen a window seat, is that still okay for you?

> I think so. I've never flown before so I thought it would be nice to look out at the clouds. Dou you think it will be a good seat for me?

> This is your first flight? Well, that's fantastic! You're going to love it. And yes, I think the window seat is an excellent choice for you then. Let me print your **boarding pass**, and you'll be ready to go.
